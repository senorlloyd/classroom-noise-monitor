This simple app was created using ChatGPT with the sole purpose of monitoring noise inside the classroom.  
Tested and working in IOS using Safari for teacher iPad use or else desktop/laptop with microphone should work as well.
Since different mics and input volumes do different things, I went with some sensitivity controls to dial in what the the teacher thinks is the appropriate sensitivity for the room where it's being used.
